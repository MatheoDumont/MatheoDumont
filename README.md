### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
I am Matheo Dumont, i studied Computer Science and more precisely 3D technologies at the University Claude Bernard in Lyon, ID3D curriculum.

I've done my internship at the LIRMM(the laboratory of computer science, mecanic and micro-electronic of Montpellier), in the ICAR team with Noura Faraj as supervisor. 
My subject was about 'Simulating submarine environments for underwater vehicle'.

My Personal projects worth mentioning are :
- a [SAT Solver](https://github.com/MatheoDumont/sudoku-with-sat-solver/) to solve sudokus
- In [Music Clustering](https://github.com/MatheoDumont/music_clustering) i tried to make clusters of songs to find similarities that could be used to build  playlists based on genre
- Basic display of the [Mandelbrot Set](https://github.com/MatheoDumont/mandelbrot_set) using the SDL library
- My try on the Rust language with the implementation of an [AVL Tree](https://github.com/MatheoDumont/rust-avl-tree)
- A [physic engine wrote in Rust (WIP)](https://github.com/MatheoDumont/engine/)

Courses's Projects for my Master in Computer Science, centered on 3D tech and related (a lot in french):
- [Modeling of Virtual World](https://github.com/MatheoDumont/MMV_tps)
- [Animation](https://github.com/MatheoDumont/AnimaPerso)
- [Statistics Methods for Image processing](https://github.com/MatheoDumont/ImStat)
- [Algorithmic Geometry and Meshs](https://github.com/MatheoDumont/GAM)
- [Analysing and Treatement of images, 3D Vision](https://github.com/MatheoDumont/ATIV_tps)
- I also had some projects in Rendering, Ray Tracing, Signals Processing and Data Compression related to images
